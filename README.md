# Simple OrderManagement System

The Pizza Shop Application is a user-friendly React web app that streamlines pizza ordering and management. Customers can easily order Pepperoni, Cheesy, or Onion pizzas, view costs, check ingredient availability, and track order statuses (Placed, Preparing, Dispatched, Delivered). Owners have a powerful dashboard to monitor and update inventory, add or remove ingredients, manage orders, and adjust statuses. Built with Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for a sleek interface, it ensures a seamless experience for both customers and owners.
